Hi,

pypredict is a Python extension build around an updatable n-gram
language model meant to be used for word prediction in onscreen keyboards.
Beware! This is pre-alpha material, expect show stopping bugs.

Currently implemented features are:
 - N-gram language model of order two and up,
   however order three is the main target
 - N-gram smoothing with Kneser-Ney interpolation
 - Language model interpolation
 - On-line adaptation, i.e. support for continuous learning
 - Unicode support, UTF-32 internally
 - reasonably low memory usage, <30MiB per million trigrams
 - few build and runtime dependencies

Not done yet:
 - word filtering
 - LM caching
 - decrease loading time of large language models

Comments, bugs? mailto:marmvta@gmail.com


How to build
------------

Make sure you have a working gcc tool-chain and python development files.
For Ubuntu 9.10:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential python2.6-dev

Then run:

    make


Training a language model
-------------------------

First get a training text. Any reasonably large text file ought to work
for now. The sample below uses Herman Melville's Moby Dick, available
from Project Gutenberg at

     http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701.txt

Then run

    ./train moby.txt 3 moby.lm

This reads the training text, trains a language model of order 3, i.e.
it collects unigrams, bigrams and trigrams and saves it to moby.lm.


Prediction
----------

    ./predict moby.lm this Moby ""

This loads the model and predicts a list of words in decreasing
probability following "this Moby".


Keystroke Savings Rate
----------------------

Based on "EFFECTS OF NGRAM ORDER AND TRAINING TEXT SIZE ON WORD PREDICTION"
by Gregory W. Lesher†, Ph.D., Bryan J. Moulton†, M.S., and D. Jeffery .

KSR determines the percentage of saved key presses, in this case saved key
presses due to successfully predicted words. The tool "ksr" simulates
typing continuous text while trying to save a maximum number of keystrokes by
selecting matching words from a list of prediction choices.

In order to get meaningful results the simulated text must not be part of
the training corpus of the used language model. The tool "split_corpus"
divides a given text into three non-overlapping portions:
training.txt, held_out.txt and testing.txt.

Split the training corpus:

    ./split_corpus moby.txt

Then train a language model from the newly created training text:

    ./train training.txt 3 moby.lm

And finally calculate the keystroke savings for this language model
using the testing text:

    ./ksr moby.lm testing.txt 10

The last parameter here is the prediction limit, i.e. the maximum number of
word choices to choose from when ksr simulates key presses. Higher values
give better keystroke savings in theory, but these results don't easily
translate to the same savings in practice. The whole list is assumed to be
presented to the user and a long list will have reduced usability.
