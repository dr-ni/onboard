# Calculate keystroke saving rate
#
# Based on:
# "EFFECTS OF NGRAM ORDER AND TRAINING TEXT SIZE ON WORD PREDICTION"
# by Gregory W. Lesher, Ph.D., Bryan J. Moulton, M.S., and D. Jeffery
# Higginbotham, Ph.D.
#
# Usage:
# ksr <language model> <typed text> <prediction limit>
# Calculates the number of keystrokes saved with a maximum number of
# <prediction limit> predictions to choose from when typing <typed text>.
#
# Example:
# split_corpus moby.txt
# train training.txt 3 moby.lm
# ksr moby.lm testing.txt 10
# This loads language model moby.lm, uses it to create at most 10 predicted
# words per typed letter and simulates the typing of testing.txt.
